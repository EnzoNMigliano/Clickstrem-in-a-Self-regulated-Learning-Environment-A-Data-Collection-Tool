## Summary
&nbsp; &nbsp; Under research question: <code> ** How to construct a Shiny App that collects user’s behavioral data?** </code> The present study assesses the feasibility of an application that collects users’ behavioral data in a Shiny App application. The tool is meant for educational settings. The goal is to equip professors with valuable data that allows them to understand the needs and wants of students. The application developed in the present study integrates a database and a programming application interface in order to store and retrieve the data. Also, the application collects several data regarding the student interaction with graphs and their respective timestamp. Finally, the present study suggests possible analyses a professor may perform with the student’s behavioral data.
