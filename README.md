## Summary
&nbsp; &nbsp; Under research question: <code> ** How to construct a Shiny App that collects user’s behavioral data?** </code> The present study assesses the feasibility of an application that collects users’ behavioral data in a Shiny App application. The tool is meant for educational settings. The goal is to equip professors with valuable data that allows them to understand the needs and wants of students. The application developed in the present study integrates a database and a programming application interface in order to store and retrieve the data. Also, the application collects several data regarding the student interaction with graphs and their respective timestamp. Finally, the present study suggests possible analyses a professor may perform with the student’s behavioral data.

&nbsp; &nbsp; The collection of clickstream data in self-regulated learning environment has great potential. Statistical tests to check the normality of the distribution of events in different graphs will help instructors empirically address if events are normally distributed (has a normal distribution of events) or if it is not normally distributed (has a not normal distribution of events). The professor should investigate events that are not normally distributed for reasons why that happened. For example, a professor may ask for feedback from the students regarding problems with a specific graph. The professor may have an overall understanding of the user's in-app behavior through observing the events across a timeline. For example, if a user have an exponential number of events followed by a plato, the plato phase is likely towards the end of the user interaction. Also, if a user has several peaks of interaction, it may be because the user spends more time understanding the visualization, and it may indicate difficulty in understanding the material. This visualization has numerous possible insights for the professor. However, they all should be followed by a causal investigation of the phenomenon. In conclusion, the results of the pilot test of the Shiny App available at https://enzo-migliano.shinyapps.io/Explore_STEM_Majors/ demonstrated the feasibility of accessing behavioral data from users at educational Shiny Apps.
 
### R Packages Utilized
 In other to perform all the statistical analysis and develop the application we utilized several packages:
  Package Name | Package Name |  Package Name |  Package Name |
| --- | --- | --- |--- |
 |tidyverse | shiny | shinycssloaders | shinyalert |
 |plotly | ggwordcloud |  rcurl | rsconnect |

 ## Code
 The code to generate the vizualizations and the source code of the application are available at the folder called "Code". All source code is written in R. All visualizationas are availiable at the folder called "Images". Finally, a report of the entire research is available at the folder "Report".
